	<h3>About <fmt:message key="siteName"/></h3>
	
	<p>It was started with an idea of simplifying the way people post/find classifieds.</p>
	
	<p>Here, you can easily:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find classifieds near any location</li>
			<li>Share a classified with your friends</li>
			<li>Post a classified</li>
			<li>Contact the person who posted the classified</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>Currently, the content on the site is mixed. Some of it comes from Craigslist.org.</p>
		
	<p>You can post the classifieds for free and there is no upper limit on number of classifieds you can post.</p>
	
	<p>You can reach us at <fmt:message key="contactEmailAddr"/>.</p>
